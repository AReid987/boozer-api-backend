# React Boozer API

## Objectives
+ Practice connecting our client-side applications to an API

## Overview

Fork and clone this repo. We've provided a seed file with a list of cocktails (shout out to PDT for their list. )

We've setup two endpoints for you - visiting `http:localhost:3000/api/v1/cocktails` provides us with a list of all cocktails. Cocktails have many proportions, which include an amount and an ingredient name.
